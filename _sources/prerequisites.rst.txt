Software Prerequisites
======================

In this course, we will be using `OCaml <https://ocaml.org/>`_ as a
main programming language. We will be working with multi-file
projects, which will make use of various external libraries, and
involve automated testing and graphics. Because of this, you will have
to install a number of software utilities, which you did not need in
the Intro to Computer Science class. This document provides detailed
instructions on how to do so depending on the operating system you
use.

Please, allocate **at least 3 hours** for going through this setup
document, as some of the software packages listed required for our
class will take quite a while to install.
