Final Project: Vroomba Programming
==================================

The final project will consist of two parts: grop-based coding
assignments and individual implementation reports. 

Coding Assignment 
-----------------

TODO

Report
------

The reports are written and submitted on Canvas individually. They should focus on the following aspects of your experience with the project:

* High-level overview of your implementation design. How did you
  define basic data structures, what were the algorithmic decisions
  you've taken? Please, don't quote the code verbatim at length (you
  may provide 3-4 line code snippets, if necessary). Pictures,
  screenshots, and drawings are very welcome, but are not strictly
  required.

* What were your Vroomba solver strategies, interesting polygon
  generation patterns, or game part enhancements?

* What you considered important properties of your implementation? How
  did you test them?

* How the implementation effort has been split, and what were your
  personal contributions? Did you make use of the suggested split?

* Any discoveries, anecdotes, and gotchas, elaborating on your
  experience with this project.

You individual report should not be very long; please, try to make it succinct and to the point: 3-4 pages should be enough.
