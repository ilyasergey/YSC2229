Exercises
=========


Mandatory exercises
-------------------

* :ref:`exercise-find-range-sorted`: 
  Finding elements in a given range of the keys in an unsorted array.

* :ref:`exercise-exponential-search`:
  Implement and analyse the exponential search.

* :ref:`exercise-find-range-sorted`: 
  Finding elements in a given range of the keys in a sorted array with linear complexity.

* :ref:`exercise-fast-merge-sort`:
  Implement a version of merge-sort that does not allocate auxiliary arrays at every recursive call.


Recommended exercises
---------------------

* :ref:`exercise-three-way-merge-sort`:
  Implement a version of merge-sort that splits the sub-arrays into three parts and then combines them together. Compare its performance to the ordinary 2-way merge-sort.

* :ref:`exercise-index-sort`:
  Develop and implement a version of merge-sort that does not rearrange the input array ``arr``, but returns an array ``perm`` of type ``int array``, such that ``perm.(i)`` is the index of the ``i``th smalles entry in the array.
